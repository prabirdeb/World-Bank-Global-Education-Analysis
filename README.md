# Summary:

The task was to explore and analyze the World Bank EdStats All Indicator Query data to identify variations of indicators across the globe, which countries are more alike and different.

Created new data frames (common_feature_stat_df and ed_feature_stat_df) with clean statistics, created new features (male-female population difference), and dropped many features to start with data visualization

Formulated fruitful results that can help in improving the growth of different countries.
