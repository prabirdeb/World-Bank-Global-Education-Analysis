# Dataset Explanation:

The dataset was actually a collection of 47 years of experience regarding the global population and education from 1970 to 2016 with 3,665 features for 242 countries.

# Project Summary:

The task was to explore and analyze the World Bank EdStats All Indicator Query data to identify variations of indicators across the globe, which countries are more alike and different.

Created new data frames (common_feature_stat_df and ed_feature_stat_df) with clean statistics, created new features (male-female population difference), and dropped many features to start with data visualization

Formulated fruitful results that can help in improving the growth of different countries.

# Potential Impact and Future Scope:

Higher positive or negative population growth and higher gender imbalance are the root causes of system imbalance. Lower educational growth is the root cause of system weakness. Again, system imbalance and system weakness together cause unhappiness and may lead to system breakdown. 

My analysis reveals that "Cote d'Ivoire", 'Afghanistan', 'India', 'Bhutan' and 'Pakistan' have both high gender imbalance and poor female education. These five countries need to give immediate attention to improving the female population and working on female education.
